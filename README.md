# EventStore

CQRS event store implemented in Elixir. Uses [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) as the underlying storage engine.

Requires Elixir v1.5 and PostgreSQL v9.5 or newer.

EventStore supports [running on a cluster of nodes](guides/Cluster.md) (since v0.11). Stream processes will be distributed amongst all available nodes, events are published to subscribers running on any node.

## Example usage

Append events to a stream:

```elixir
stream_uuid = UUID.uuid4()
expected_version = 0
events = [
  %EventStore.EventData{
    event_type: "Elixir.ExampleEvent",
    data: %ExampleEvent{key: "value"},
    metadata: %{user: "someuser@example.com"},
  }
]

:ok = EventStore.append_to_stream(stream_uuid, expected_version, events)
```

Read all events from a single stream, starting at the stream's first event:

```elixir
{:ok, events} = EventStore.read_stream_forward(stream_uuid)
```

More: [Using the EventStore](guides/Usage.md)

Subscribe to events appended to all streams:

```elixir
{:ok, subscription} = EventStore.subscribe_to_all_streams("example_subscription", self())

receive do
  {:events, events} ->
    # ... process events & ack receipt    
    EventStore.ack(subscription, events)
end
```

## Used in production?

Yes, this event store is being used in production.

PostgreSQL is used for the underlying storage. Providing guarantees to store data securely. It is ACID-compliant and transactional. PostgreSQL has a proven architecture. A strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.

## Backup and administration

You can use any standard PostgreSQL tool to manage the event store data:

- [Backup and restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/backup-dump.html).
- [Continuous archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/continuous-archiving.html).

## Benchmarking performance

Run the benchmark suite using mix with the `bench` environment, as configured in `config/bench.exs`. Logging is disabled for benchmarking.

```console
$ MIX_ENV=bench mix do es.reset, app.start, bench
```

Example output:

```
